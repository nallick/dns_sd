//  FD.swift
//
//  The C structure fd_set is an OS system defined bit field containing FD_SETSIZE (e.g. 1024) bits.
//  In C, this is implemented as a fixed size array of integers which Swift interprets as a tuple.
//  Unfortunately various Linux distributions (as well as Darwin) vary regarding integer size and count.
//  This means the number of tuple elements Swift imports from C varies from platform to platform.
//  Platform C headers define C macros to perform bitfield functions on fd_set. This file provides those as Swift functions.
//  Previous versions of this file have reimplemented the macros in pure Swift, but since Swift doesn't allow compile-time
//  variations to account for the number of elements in the fd_set tuple, this solution isn't portable.
//  The portable solution used here calls the platform's C macros through C language wrapper functions visible to Swift.
